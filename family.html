        <h3><i>MY MOM</i></h3>
        <p style="color:goldenrod">My mom is Angie Bedolla and she is the best. She had me at the young age of 17 and overcame so many challenges and obtacles. She is always there for me on my good days and bad days. Her birthday is in August, her favorite color is black and I am the child that looks most like her.</p>

        <h3><i>MY DAD</i></h3>
        <p style="color:brown">My dad is Jesse Bedolla and he is an awesome cook. He was a year older than my mom when I was born but he stayed throughout her side every step of the way. He is a major sports fan and loves spending his days off work playing video games. I was lucky enough to inherit his spice tolerance but sometimes we don't know when to stop.</p>

        <h3><i>MY SIBLINGS</i></h3>
        <p style="color:darkorange">I have two younger siblings: Ellie and Jacob. Jacob is five years younger and Ellie is ten years younger. When I am home from school for a break we all like to go get food and snack together and then come home to watch movies. While it is hard taking care of younger siblings they are always there for me and I wouldn't have it any other way.</p>
