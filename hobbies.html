        <h3><i>Cooking</i></h3>
        <p style="color:darkorange">Some of my favorite ways to pass the time or relax is by cooking some comfort foods. In this photo I cooked some chicken sausage, potatoes, and broccoli. To me cooking is a form of therapy when I have had a rough day because it is something I can't mess up on and it always comes out tasting good so my heart feels full.</p>

        <h3><i>Hanging out with Friends</i></h3>
        <p style="color:goldenrod">Over the summer I worked for the Office of Student Transition and Family Engagement and I went in with the intention of just doing what was asked of me but I left with so much more. The people in the photo are half of the friends I made during the summer and I could not be more grateful for them. While we all vary in age and majors we love hanging out with each other. We have had barbecues, gone golfing, bowling, etc.</p>

        <h3><i>Exploring Campus</i></h3>
        <p style="color:brown">After being here for over three years there is still so much I have yet to discover on campus. So I like to take walks around Campus to see if I find anything cool like a new coffee place, study spot, but my favorite place to walk through is the lakeshore path. While I am not a fan of bugs being surrounded by nature is quite comforting because it is so peaceful.</p>
