    <h1>My Travels</h1>
    <h4><i>Over the past four years I have traveled to other states and countries. 
        My top three favorites have been Hawaii in the summer of 2021, Mexico in the summer of 2022 (after my highschool graduation), and then Tennessee in the fall of 2023.</i></h4>

        <h3><i>Hawaii</i></h3>
        <p style="color:brown">This picture was taken by the beach near our hotel as that day was our last day before heading home. Everything is so green, lively, and fresh on the island. I am someone that loves poke so having it extremely fresh with all of my favorite toppings was so good. Everyday I woke up with a smile on my face and felt at peace because aside from rain there was nothing that could ruin the vibe. </p>

        <h3><i>Mexico</i></h3>
        <p style="color:goldenrod">My cousin and I both graduated high school and our families decided to celebrate us by taking a trip down to Mexico. We stayed at an all inclusive resort in Playa del Carmen and the way to get to the beach was through the dining area, through a little jungle, and then the pool area. The food was amazing, music all the time, I got to swim with the dolphins. I would very much like to go back.</p>

        <h3><i>Tennessee</i></h3>
        <p style="color:darkorange">The fall of my sophomore year here at Madison my cousins and I took a trip down to Nashville. There were so many bars on the entire strip but we went more on the shopping route and exploring the little shops. I got myself a pair of boots because they are very big on that there. It was extremely humid but that did not stop me from going to a resturant and learning how to line dance. I remember them teaching us Ed Sheeran's song Shivers.</p>
