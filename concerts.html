        <h3><i>Peso Pluma</i></h3>
        <p style="color:darkorange">In 2023 Peso Pluma came to the United Center and I went with my brother and cousin Sophie. He is a Mexican artist whos genre of is music corridos tumbados which is a style of ballads that takes a mix of reggaeton and hip hop. My favorite song from the concert was Nueva Vida because he describes how God has helped him get through so much and given him the life he has now. </p>

        <h3><i>Kendrick Lamar</i></h3>
        <p style="color:goldenrod">This concert was the most recent happening a couple of months ago. The icon Kendrick Lamar sold out Soldier Field and it was awesome. His style of music is rap and hip hop and he was touring sith SZA who is one of my other favorite artists. My brother and I had a blast and our favorite song from his setlist would be Like That. </p>

        <h3><i>Rauw Alejandro</i></h3>
        <p style="color:brown"> Rauw Alejandro was a month before the Kendrick Lamar concert and Rauw is by far my favorite artist. His concert is my favorite by far because I knew the lyrics of every song by heart. His music varies in genre from reggaeton, electronic dance, pop, etc. Although I was super high up for the concert I went to his after party with my cousins and got to see him up close and it was amazing. </p>
